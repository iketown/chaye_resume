        When I joined the ranks of Emma, they were a month to month service that
        had aspirations to compete with the Enterprise email marketing companies
        offering long term contracts and expert services. I handled larger
        accounts with a focus on selling yearly subscriptions and services to
        help guide their marketing plans. I became an{' '}
        <b>email marketing expert </b>
        that could advise on the different package options, as well as best
        practices to help grow their subscriber lists and customer loyalty.
