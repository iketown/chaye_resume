I spend my free time chasing around two energetic baby boys and stealing moments in between the chaos with my wonderful husband.

I am a former yoga and spin instructor, and although I no longer teach, I love to be active and move every single day. I use my peloton often, I appreciate any outdoor exercise such as running or hiking, and I like the challenge of HIIT and weights.

I find peace in the kitchen; I show my love by cooking for family and friends. I try to get a home cooked meal on the table most nights and fresh baked cookies for special occasions.

I have traveled often with my husband and love the idea of more trips in our future. Returning to Amsterdam and Paris are top on my list; visiting Bali is also a “priority.”

I work hard and also make time to soak up the sweet moments with friends and family. Thanks for taking the time to learn more about me. Xo- Chaye
