My name is Chaye Eichenberger, nice to meet you!

I have been in Sales, Business Development, and Account Management for 16+ years. I’ve worked for large companies like Gaylord Hotels and American Express, as well as start ups such as Emma and GoNoodle.

My experience spans multiple industries, including [hospitality](#gaylord), [SaaS](#emma), [travel](#amex), [entertainment](#goNoodle), and [media](#goNoodle).

While working in larger companies, I’ve come to understand the benefits of corporate structure and processes, the cadence of building business, and the requirements for making change.

Through my time spent with startups, I have grown familiar with the drive for innovation, the need to be nimble, and the entrepreneurial spirit it takes to stay motivated.

I recognize the benefits and limitations that both face and know how to successfully navigate each. I believe my biggest contributions to a company are my ability to collaborate and bring teams together, define strategy and differentiate a product or service, develop processes to drive efficiency, and build strong client relationships.

I have experience with selling, negotiating, and delivering on the product/service, allowing me to understand both top and bottom line impact. I have <modal-link to="diverseTeams">led diverse teams</modal-link>; managed large, <modal-link to="cdProjects">cross-departmental projects</modal-link>; and spearheaded the ideation, creation, and execution of <modal-link to="salesStrategies">sales strategies</modal-link>, bespoke campaigns, and new products for market.
